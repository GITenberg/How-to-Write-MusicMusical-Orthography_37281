<p class="center page-break" style="font-size: x-large;"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_1" title="1"> </a>How to Write Music</p>

<hr/>

<p class="sidenote">
Introductory.
</p>

<p><a name="Par_1">1.</a>&mdash;It is reasonable to expect that a
musician shall be at least an accurate
and legible writer as well as a reader of the
language of his Art. The immense increase in
the amount of music published, and its cheapness,
seem rather to have increased than decreased
this necessity, for they have vastly
multiplied activity in the Art. If they have not
intensified the necessity for music-writing, they
have increased the number of those by whom
the necessity is felt.</p>

<p>Intelligent knowledge of Notation is the
more necessary inasmuch as music-writing is in
only a comparatively few cases mere copying.
Even when writing from a copy, some alteration
is frequently necessary, as will be shown
in the following pages, requiring independent
knowledge of the subject on the part of the
copyist. (See <i>e.g.</i>, <a href="#Par_28">par.&nbsp;28</a>.)</p>

<p>Yet many musicians, thoroughly competent as
performers, cannot write a measure of music without
bringing a smile to the lips of the initiated.</p>

<p>Many performers will play or sing a note at
sight without hesitation, which, asked to write,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_2" title="2"> </a>
they will first falter over and then bungle&mdash;at
least by writing it at the wrong octave.</p>

<p>The admirable working of theoretical examination
papers is sometimes in ridiculous contrast
with the puerility of the writing.</p>

<p>Psychologists would probably say that this
was because conceptual action is a higher
mental function than perceptual: in other
words, that recollection is harder than recognition.</p>

<p>The remedy is simple. Recognition must be
developed till it becomes recollection: the writing
of music must be taught concurrently with
the reading of it.</p>

<p>This was once the case: music-writing was a
necessary part of a musician's education. One
may be the more surprised at its falling
into disuse, inasmuch as phonography&mdash;in the
musical sense&mdash;is a distinctly pleasant occupation.
Without being either drawing or writing,
it partakes of the nature of both.</p>

<p>But many points in the writing of music
are not now considered to form part of the
Rudiments of Music, and are not included in
primers on the subject.</p>

<p>Hence the following pages.</p>

<p>While containing some matter which may
have escaped the attention of more advanced
musicians, they should, in an educational
course, either be used along with a Primer
on the Elements, or immediately follow it.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p class="sidenote">
Choice of
Paper.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_3" title="3"> </a><a name="Par_2">2.</a>&mdash;The first matter to claim attention
in making a manuscript copy of
music is choice of the right kind of
music-paper. This will primarily be determined
by the number of staves each score requires.
Most paper contains twelve staves to the page.
This is a most convenient number, allowing for
a two-, three-, four-, or six-stave score.</p>

<p>Song-paper: three-stave score, two staves
being braced for the piano part, with a third for
the voice part. This latter is at a considerable
distance above the other staves, to allow room
for writing in the words.</p>

<p>Organ-music paper: three-stave score, two
staves braced for manual part, and another
underneath for pedal part.</p>

<p>Quartet-paper: <ins title="four stave">four-stave</ins> score, no brackets
or clefs.</p>

<p>Quartet-paper with accompaniment: six-stave
score, two bracketed for piano part.</p>

<p>Full-score paper: much smaller than short-score
staves. Very useful for other purposes
where a small, narrow stave is required.</p>

<p>For piano and violin music, paper should be
chosen the staves of which are wide apart, to
allow of the large number of leger lines frequently
required.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p class="sidenote">
Scoring.
</p>

<p><a name="Par_3">3.</a>&mdash;The paper chosen, the first use
of a pen will be in ruling the score-lines.
A &ldquo;score&rdquo; technically is as many
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_4" title="4"> </a>
staves as are <em>performed simultaneously</em>: two in
pianoforte music, three in organ music, four in
an unaccompanied quartet, six in four-part
vocal music with piano accompaniment, and
so on. These staves have a line drawn down
their left-hand edge. Hence the name, from
their being <em>scored</em> through.</p>

<p>Their position always being at the left-hand
edge of the staves, and their length determined by
the number of staves, they may be drawn before
the length of the measures has been arranged.</p>

<p>Care must be taken when a page is ruled at a
time not to draw the score-line through more than
the necessary number of staves. Except in a full
score there will generally be at least two, and,
of course, very often more, scores to the page.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p class="sidenote">
Barring.
</p>

<p><a name="Par_4">4.</a>&mdash;After the score-lines come the
bar-lines. And with the arranging
of these begins that <em>careful mapping-out</em> of the
whole work, neglect of which will lead to endless
annoyance and dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>Some music is so uniform that a given space
may be assigned to each measure, and consequently
a uniform number of measures to each
score, provided that there is no change of key
or time. In determining this space allowance
must be made (1) in the first measure of each
movement for the key and time signatures,
which may require a considerable space; (2)
in the first measure of each score for the <em>key</em>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_5" title="5"> </a>
signature: the time signature is only repeated
at the beginning of each movement or when the
time is changed; (3) regard must be had to
where a turn-over will come, some passages
allowing of this so much more easily than
others; (4) also to the number of measures
in the entire movement, otherwise a new page
may have to be added for only one measure!
(5) in vocal music careful regard must be paid
to the words as well as the notes. A syllable
will often require more space than a note,
consequently in very simple music the words
require more space than the music. In florid
compositions a syllable, on the other hand, is
often sung, not to several notes merely, but
to several measures, and the music requires
much more space than the words. In the former
case the author has found it a good plan to
write the words first, or at least a measure or
two of them, as a guide in estimating their
average length. But, while the words must not
be cramped, they must fall under the notes
to which they are to be sung, and as these notes
must occupy as nearly as possible their proportionate
part of the measure, the skilful
scribe will keep both words and music in mind
simultaneously. Where, however, in vocal or
instrumental music the measures vary greatly,
one having, perhaps, a single whole note and
the next thirty-two thirty-second notes, it is
necessary to plan each score separately, or
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_6" title="6"> </a>
the end may be reached with too much space
for the last measure, but not enough for another
one. Carrying a measure from the end
of one score to the beginning of the next is not
practised now, as it once was.</p>

<p>Bar-lines are usually drawn through each
stave of vocal music separately, and in instrumental
music through as many staves as
belong to the same instrument or group of
instruments, <i>e.g.</i>, through the two staves of a
piano part, and the four or five belonging to the
&ldquo;strings&rdquo; in a full score. These instrumental
staves are also usually connected by a brace
at the left-hand edge of each score thus:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 202px;">
<a name="Fig_1"><img src="images/fig01.png" width="202" height="118" alt=""/></a>
<p class="caption">Fig.&nbsp;1.</p>
</div>

<p>Uniform bar-lines may be ruled a page at a
time, if care be taken not to make the line continuous
through more than the required number
of staves. It is a fault which one commits
the moment watchfulness is relaxed, and entails
much scratching out. Where the measures vary
in length the ruling will most readily be done in
light pencil with a T square, and afterwards
inked. A single bar-line out of the perpendicular
will spoil the appearance of a whole page.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p class="sidenote">
Clefs.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_7" title="7"> </a><a name="Par_5">5.</a>&mdash;The first actual musical characters
to be written are the clefs.
Misconception of the function of these is so
common, not among practical musicians only,
but on the part of elementary theorists, that a
few words of explanation are necessary. The
commonest fallacies are to suppose that if
clefs are the right shape their exact position
on the stave does not matter, and that their
position varies. Both suppositions are, to
quote a delightful Ruskinism, &ldquo;accurately
false.&rdquo; A clef identifies and originally was used
with <em>a single line</em>, and identifies others only
by their relationship to this. Hence its precise
shape is of less importance than its being on
the right line. Indeed, the shape of clefs has
varied so much that many able practical musicians
do not know that they were originally
simple letters, the treble clef a small &ldquo;g,&rdquo; the
bass clef a small &ldquo;f.&rdquo; From this beginning has
been evolved so elaborate a sign, sometimes
not merely covering all the lines of a stave,
but going beyond them, that it is necessary
to explain which line a clef is on. Thus the
&ldquo;G,&rdquo; or treble clef, is on that line which its
interior termination is on, and which it curls
round, touching it in all <em>four times</em>. The upper
part of the treble clef is sometimes kept within
the stave, but, as in the present examples,
more often rises above the stave. The point is
merely a matter of taste.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_8" title="8"> </a>The C clef is on that line which has an oblique
or straight stroke, or pot-hook, above and below.</p>

<p>The F clef is on that line which its interior
termination is on, and which it curls round
either to the right or the left, and which has a
dot above and below.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 337px;">
<a name="Fig_2"><img src="images/fig02.png" width="337" height="56" alt=""/></a>
<p class="caption">Fig.&nbsp;2.</p>
</div>

<p>And this position never varies. Whatever
line the F clef is on is F, however many or few
lines may be above or below it.</p>

<p>In olden days any clef line might be taken
with any number of lines above and below. For
instance, the F line with two lines below and
two above; or three below and one above.
This is not now done with treble and bass
clefs, which are only used with respectively the
top and bottom five lines of the Great Stave of
eleven lines. Hence care must be taken to
write the treble clef on the <em>second</em>, and the
bass clef on the <em>fourth</em> line of its stave. But it
is still customary to use the C clef, especially
in viola and trombone music, with both two
lines above and two below, making the alto
stave; and three below and one above, making
the tenor stave. These staves are also used in
old vocal music, and familiarity with them is
absolutely necessary in all advanced theoretical
examinations. The C clef, therefore, <em>appears</em>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_9" title="9"> </a>
to move, being sometimes on the third and
sometimes on the fourth line. Really it is
always on the same line, and it is the <em>selection
of lines</em> which varies. Hence the misdescription
of the treble and bass clefs as &ldquo;immovable,&rdquo;
the C clef as &ldquo;movable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Note that all clefs are on lines; no clef is in a
space. This is because the first attempt to
accurately represent music to the eye was by
means of a single line with a letter at the beginning.
This was what has since become the
fourth line, the clef line, of the bass stave.</p>

<p>In pianoforte and organ music, high parts
for the left hand, or low ones for the right,
may be written either:</p>

<p>By means of leger lines (<a href="#Fig_3">Fig.&nbsp;3</a>, <i>a</i>);</p>

<p>By changing the clef (<i>b</i>); or</p>

<p>By writing the part in the stave proper to the
other hand (<i>c</i>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 491px;">

<p class="caption">Fig.&nbsp;3.</p>
</div>

<p>The example, of course, illustrates a high
part for the left hand.</p>

<p>The first method is the hardest to write and
read. There is not much to choose between
the second and third. If the third be adopted
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_10" title="10"> </a>
care must be taken not to insert rests in the
vacant stave: their absence shows that the
<em>hand</em> is not resting.</p>

<p>When a part, in organ or piano music, though
mainly in its proper stave, <em>begins</em> with notes
more easily written in the other, the clef proper
to the part should be inserted, as showing its
general character, and immediately followed
by that in which the notes are most conveniently
written. Thus <a href="#Fig_3">Fig.&nbsp;3</a>, <i>b</i>, if the <em>first</em> measure
of a composition, should have an F clef immediately
preceding the G clef in the left-hand
part.</p>

<p>A change of clef affecting the <em>first note of
a score</em> should be anticipated in the last
measure of the previous score, and repeated
in the measure affected. This is especially
the case in regard to the first score of a new
page involving a turn-over. In addition to
anticipating the clef, the old plan of inserting
a &ldquo;direct&rdquo; is to be recommended. See
<a href="#Fig_4">Fig.&nbsp;4</a>.</p>

Signatures.
</p>

<p><a name="Par_6">6.</a>&mdash;Following the clef comes the key
signature. In printed music this is
repeated at the beginning of every score. As
preventing many mistakes the repetition is
desirable. But in manuscript music it is
very usual to repeat it only at the head of each
page. Common faults are:</p>

<p>(1) Placing the sharps or flats at the wrong
octave. The first sharp should, in the treble
clef, be on the top line, not in the bottom
space. And the second flat should be in the
top space, not on the bottom line. The customary
way of writing signatures is not, in the
writer's opinion, invariably the best. But
solecisms, though not in themselves inaccurate,
should be avoided as causing unnecessary trouble
and confusion.</p>

<p>(2) A perhaps commoner fault is in not
allowing sufficient space for the signature, and
therefore cramping it. Each sharp or flat
should be well to the right-hand of the preceding
one, never over or under it.</p>

<p>(3) Sharps, flats, and naturals, like clefs,
cover much more of the stave than the single
line or space which they govern. Not nearly
enough care is usually exercised to make the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_12" title="12"> </a>
center of the sharp, or the loop of the flat,
exactly correspond with this, as it should.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p><a name="Par_7">7.</a>&mdash;The time signature need only be inserted
where there is a change of movement. In
common time there is a choice between the
numeral signature &ldquo;4/4&rdquo; and the letter signature
&ldquo;C.&rdquo; The latter is the more interesting
historically. Originally it was not a letter at
all; the monks, who originated modern musical
notation, called triple time &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; in honor
of the Blessed Trinity, and represented it
with the sign of perfection&mdash;a circle: common,
or quadruple time, they called imperfect, and
cut a slice out of the right-hand side of the
circle to represent imperfection. This printers,
not unnaturally, mistook for the initial letter
of &ldquo;Common Time.&rdquo; But the numeral signature
is rapidly superseding this, as showing the
exact value of a measure, and being in accordance
with the signatures of all other kinds of
time.</p>

<p class="sidenote">
Notation of
Rhythm.
</p>

<p><a name="Par_8">8.</a>&mdash;Following the time-signature
come the notes. The guiding principle
in writing these is that their right
interpretation shall be apparent to the eye.
Two points are of paramount importance.
These are (1) the selection of the right characters
(this of course only affects those who are writing
original compositions or arrangements, not
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_13" title="13"> </a>
mere copists), and (2) the correct placing of
these in the measure. The bare duration of a
note, its merely arithmetical value, can generally
be expressed in more ways than one. But
this is not sufficient. That way must be selected
which represents its <em>rhythm</em>, its correct accentuation,
<em>to the eye</em>. Simple forms of time, as
distinct from Compound, contain but few
pitfalls, and even an inexperienced writer is
not likely to go far wrong.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p><a name="Par_9">9.</a>&mdash;It may be as well to warn such an one,
however, that it is not nowadays customary
to dot an unaccented note or rest. The dot
in this case would represent the succeeding
accented beat, and not represent it nearly as
significantly as does a tied note or separate
rest; compare <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, <a href="#Fig_5">Fig.&nbsp;5</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 371px;">

<p><a name="Par_10">10.</a>&mdash;Tied notes should not be employed
where a single note would represent the same
sound <em>without misrepresenting the rhythm</em>.
Their chief function is to represent durations
which <em>cannot</em> be represented by a single character,
such as five eighth notes.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_14" title="14"> </a><a name="Par_11">11.</a>&mdash;In pianoforte music a note is very
occasionally intended to be reiterated before
the first iteration has ceased to sound. This
is effected by allowing the key to rise sufficiently
to release the hammer, but not sufficiently to
reimpose the damper on the string. The second
sound therefore overtakes the first. (It is
comparatively easy on some pianos and very
hard on others.) As the sound, though periodically
reinforced, is continuous, the composer
indicates his intention by a tie. There is nothing
but one's judgment to distinguish this from
the ordinary kind of tie. The chief indication
is the employment of a tie where a single musical
character would otherwise have been better.
For instance, the following tied sixteenth notes
from the Adagio of Beethoven's Sonata, Op.&nbsp;106,
could better have been represented by
eighth notes, had it not been for the intention
of overlapping iteration (<a href="#Fig_6">Fig.&nbsp;6</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 341px;">
<a name="Fig_6"><img src="images/fig06.png" width="341" height="82" alt=""/></a>
<p class="caption">Fig.&nbsp;6.</p>
</div>

<p>The ties commencing in measure 134 of
Beethoven's well-known Sonata Pastorale were
evidently regarded by Cipriani Potter as of
this order. As having been a personal friend
of Beethoven's he was likely to know. (The
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_15" title="15"> </a>
great composer refers to him in corresponding
with Ries in 1818.) The duration of these
notes <em>could not have been written otherwise</em> than
by means of ties. The above test is therefore
inapplicable; this is evidently why, in the edition
edited by Potter, they are marked with a
tie <em>plus</em> a dot and horizontal stroke (<a href="#Fig_6a">Fig.&nbsp;6a</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 275px;">
<a name="Fig_6a"><img src="images/fig06a.png" width="275" height="69" alt=""/></a>
<p class="caption">Fig.&nbsp;6a.</p>
</div>

<p>Another indication is the tying of an unaccented
note to an accented one, thus obliterating
the accent if the tie be observed literally
(instances occur in Chopin's Valse, Op.&nbsp;31, No.&nbsp;1).
So much critical judgment, however, is
required to distinguish this treatment from that
proper to a tie, that composers would do well to
adopt some such method as Cipriani Potter's
to make their exact meaning clear.</p>

<p>This interpretation of a tie, according to which
the notes, since they overlap, are <em>just not separated</em>,
must not be confused with the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">mezzo-staccato</i>
touch, also indicated with a slur, but
having dots also (in the case of a single note
indicated by a stroke with a dot), and which
means that the notes are to be <em>just not joined</em>.
In <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">legato</i>, of course, they should be neither separated
nor overlapping, but exactly contiguous.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_16" title="16"> </a><a name="Par_12">12.</a>&mdash;The commonest errors in simple time
are not in regard to notes, but rests. This is
because silence <em>cannot be divided or syncopated</em>,
and therefore that would often be quite right as
a representation of sound which is quite wrong
as a representation of silence. Thus a beat
should not be represented by two rests where one
would do, though it might be by two notes (see
<i>a</i>, <a href="#Fig_7">Fig.&nbsp;7</a>). Nor one rest represent parts of two
beats (see <i>b</i>, <a href="#Fig_7">Fig.&nbsp;7</a>). Nor one rest represent an
unaccented and an accented beat (see <i>c</i>, <a href="#Fig_7">Fig.&nbsp;7</a>).
In triple time it is better to avoid a single rest
representing the latter and greater part of a
measure (see <i>d</i>, <a href="#Fig_7">Fig.&nbsp;7</a>), indeed, it may be said that
half-note rests should not be used in triple time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 486px;">

</div>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p><a name="Par_13">13.</a>&mdash;But in compound time errors, if not
more numerous in kind, are much more common
anyway in regard to <em>notes</em> as distinct from rests.
A note should never be written which represents
a beat and <em>part</em> of another. The commonest
violation of this principle&mdash;and it is very common&mdash;is
in writing a dotted half note in six-eight
time; this divides the measure into three
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_17" title="17"> </a>
thirds instead of two halves, by representing
a beat-and-a-third and two thirds of a beat
(see <i>a</i>, <a href="#Fig_8">Fig.&nbsp;8</a>). A beat-and-a-third, if required,
should be represented by a note of the value of
a beat tied to one of the value of a third, never
by a single note equalling both&mdash;a half note in
this case (see <i>b</i>, <a href="#Fig_8">Fig.&nbsp;8</a>). A similar principle
applies to rests. A measure's silence should be
represented by rests divisible into beats, not by
rests which fuse a beat and part of the next (see
<i>c</i>, <a href="#Fig_8">Fig.&nbsp;8</a>). Two dotted quarter notes in twelve-sixteen
time are not so bad as a dotted half
note in six-eight time, as they correctly represent
the division of the measure into two halves,
but they misrepresent these halves as consisting
of three sixths of a measure whereas they rhythmically
consist of two quarters (see <i>d</i>, <a href="#Fig_8">Fig.&nbsp;8</a>).</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_18" title="18"> </a>A twelve-sixteen measure of <em>silence</em> is much
easier to write, since it can be done by a single
whole note rest, which is also commonly used
as a measure-rest, irrespective of the value of
the measure. (Hence the German name <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">taktpause</i>.)
The six-eight measure of silence (see
<i>c</i>, <a href="#Fig_8">Fig.&nbsp;8</a>) might also, of course, have been written
in the above way, or by <em>quarter</em>, <em>eighth</em>, <em>quarter</em>,
<em>eighth</em> rests in place of the dotted rests.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p class="sidenote">
Placing of
Notes.
</p>

<p><a name="Par_14">14.</a>&mdash;The characters which will correctly
represent the given rhythm
having been determined, the second
point is the correct placing of them in the measure.
Mentally, at least, the measure should be
divided into as many equal portions as there
are beats in it. One well-known composer, it is
said, <em>rules</em> beat-lines in light pencil, as well as
bar-lines, in his full scores. In very elaborate
music this symmetrical arrangement cannot be
fully carried out; sixty-four sixty-fourth notes
cannot be written in the same space as one whole
note; and a whole note would look lost in the
space required for the sixty-fourth notes. But
simple music can be made quite symmetrical,
and in all music such beat-lines, actual or mental,
are an invaluable check and guide.</p>

<p>Each note should be placed in the <em>left</em>-hand
end of its space. This is for the simple reason
that music, like words, is read from left to right
and, roughly, space represents duration. Any
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_19" title="19"> </a>
other arrangement is misleading, as may be
seen from old music, in which a note was often
placed in the <em>middle</em> of its space. The following
(<a href="#Fig_9">Fig.&nbsp;9</a>) is an example from an organ work of
Rinck's (1770&ndash;1846).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 186px;">
<a name="Fig_9"><img src="images/fig09.png" width="186" height="53" alt=""/></a>
<p class="caption">Fig.&nbsp;9.</p>
</div>

<p>But for the fact that in open score half notes
below the middle line have their stems turned
down, even an expert would not improbably
suppose the time to be four half notes in the bar.
This is not the case, the time is two half notes
and the whole note is to be sounded <em>simultaneously</em>
with the two half notes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confusion worse confounded,&rdquo; is, so far as
the eye is concerned, hardly too strong a term
to apply to the results of this illogical method
when applied to polyphonic music. Compare
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, <a href="#Fig_10">Fig.&nbsp;10</a>, in the former of which four
notes intended to be begun simultaneously are
no two of them in line, owing to each being in
the <em>middle</em> of its space!</p>

<p class="caption">Fig.&nbsp;10.</p>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_20" title="20"> </a>This practice was consistently carried out,
even when it involved writing a note on the bar-line!
or a note in one measure and its dot in the

</div>

<p>(Pianists will recall a modern instance, so
far as the dot is concerned, in a little exercise
in C major of Czerny's.)</p>

<p>The practice cannot have been due to the
non-invention of the &ldquo;tie&rdquo; or &ldquo;bind.&rdquo; For
though the first use of this is difficult to trace,
clear instances, in the form of a bracket, ︷,
occur in Morley's <cite>Practical Music</cite>, published
in 1597.</p>

<p class="sidenote">
Rests.
</p>

<p><a name="Par_15">15.</a>&mdash;Rests, especially whole note
rests, when used for a whole measure,
are still very often illogically placed
in the <em>middle</em> of the space they represent. This
has been defended on the ground that they represent
silence or <em>inaction</em>, and that therefore no
error can arise from their appearance being deferred.
But a performer should be conscious of
the action <em>or inaction</em> of every voice or part.
If there be a seeming vacuum or hiatus, how is
he to know whether it is a note or rest which has
been omitted? If he concludes, from the absence
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_21" title="21"> </a>
of any note, that a rest is intended, he can
only <em>guess</em> how long it will prove to be when it
does come. Therefore, in the writer's opinion,
rests should be located on the same principle as
notes. If it be not a profanation to say so, since
the example is from Bach, the rest in <a href="#Fig_12">Fig.&nbsp;12</a>
would have been better placed at the beginning
of the measure. Let a sheet of paper be held
over the right half of the measure, and though
the player will be able to begin, he will not know
in how many parts the piece is written.</p>

<p><a name="Par_16">16.</a>&mdash;In open score, that is, in writing a single
melody or part on one stave, it is usual to make
whole note rests below the fourth line, and
half note rests above the third. Quarter note
rests should be written exactly in the middle of
the stave. The crook of eighth note rests, and
the upper crook of shorter rests, is generally
placed in the third space, in the absence of any
reason to the contrary. The stems of rests are,
in manuscript music especially, better slanted
somewhat. This helps to distinguish them from
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_22" title="22"> </a>
the stems of notes&mdash;in rapidly written manuscript
a not unimportant thing!</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p><a name="Par_17">17.</a>&mdash;There are two forms of quarter note
rest, the English, which is like the eighth note
rest but turned to the right-hand, and the
German, which is somewhat difficult to describe.
The German is far the better of the two as being
much more distinct from the eighth note rest.
It is, however, harder to write, and of the
slightly varying forms, perhaps the easiest is
that with a crook at each end of a very oblique
stem and which is thus very much like a reversed
letter Z (see the first example in <a href="#Fig_13">Fig.&nbsp;13</a>).</p>

more parts or voices on one stave, the rests are
placed, not only in the top or bottom space of
the stave as may best indicate to which part
they apply, but above and below it, involving,
in the case of whole note and half note rests, the
use of a leger-line (see <i>b</i>, <a href="#Fig_14">Fig.&nbsp;14</a>). This is
partly because <em>the stems of all rests are turned
down</em>, and therefore cannot be made, as the
stems of notes can, to indicate the part they
belong to by the direction taken. This, therefore,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_23" title="23"> </a>
has to be shown by their position on, or off,
the stave (see <a href="#Fig_14">Fig.&nbsp;14</a>).</p>

no means on a line with it.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p><a name="Par_19">19.</a>&mdash;In modern piano music which is not of a
strictly part-writing character, rests often represent
the absence, not of a part or voice, <em>but of the
hand</em>. If the notes, though representing as
many parts as the piece can be supposed to
possess, are all to be played by one hand, rests
are employed to represent the absence of the
other.</p>

<p>And in music which <em>is</em> of a part-writing character,
though the parts are <em>incomplete</em>, rests are
often <em>not</em> employed if both hands are engaged
(see <a href="#Fig_3">Fig.&nbsp;3</a>, <i>c</i>, bass clef, supposing it to be of
more than two parts).</p>

<p>Bach rarely, if ever, employed rests to represent
the hand; with him they always represent
a voice. Thus in a melodic or one-part passage
divided between the hands, each playing alternate
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_24" title="24"> </a>
groups, he used no rests to represent the
absent hand. These, appearing simultaneously
with the notes, would have implied a second
part. With him rests represent a living, though
absent, voice; in modern usage they frequently
represent, not music, but the way of playing it.
See <a href="#Fig_15">Fig.&nbsp;15</a>, the first half of which is in <em>two</em> parts,
therefore rests represent the thirty-second note
silences; and the second half of which is in <em>one</em>
part, therefore no rests are employed though

Dots.
</p>

<p><a name="Par_20">20.</a>&mdash;Dots are used in music for
three purposes: (1) as repeat marks,
(2) to indicate semi-staccato, (3) to
prolong a note one half. As repeat marks, they
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_25" title="25"> </a>
may be placed in each of the four spaces of the
stave (which in the writer's opinion is the better
plan, as being less liable to confusion with time-dots),
or in the second and third spaces only,
in accordance with a modern custom. <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Staccato</i>
dots and <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">staccatissimo</i> dashes, when two parts
are being written on one stave, should be placed
below the note if applying to the lower part, and
above if applying to the higher. In the case of
open score (a single part on one stave), they are
best placed on the side opposite the stem.</p>

<p>Time-dots, or those which prolong a note one
half, if applied to a note in a space, should be in
the same space as the note; if applied to a note
on a line they should be placed in the space
above, if the next note of the part is higher, and
in the space below if it is lower. The importance
of this usage is often overlooked. If it
cannot be called a rule, it is high time it was
made one! When two parts are written on one
stave, and a note is doubled, having two stems,
one up and the other down, to indicate this,
and in one part it is dotted, and in the other
not, it is impossible, apart from this rule, to
tell which part has the note dotted and which
not (except, of course, from the context, which
may expose any mistake). The following
example from Henry Smart's &ldquo;Festive March in
D,&rdquo; for the organ, appears to contain two dotted
half notes. It would probably be so read by
anyone playing the passage at sight. The context
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_26" title="26"> </a>
shows that it is the eighth note not the
half note which is intended to be dotted. All
the dots except that to the last note but one
should have been in the space <em>below</em> the note,
where this is on a line.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 435px;">

<p class="caption">Fig.&nbsp;16.</p>
</div>

<p>Logic would suggest that where a doubled,
that is a two-stemmed, note is dotted in both
parts or voices, <em>two</em> dots should follow one above
the other. This would, however, be awkward
when the note was in a space; and also when it
was on a line, if, as in the last group above, <em>both</em>

<p>Elsewhere throughout the same study the
composer has placed dots immediately after the
note they prolong. Here, therefore, he seems
to have anticipated the objection that he was
dotting <em>un</em>-accented notes (see &ldquo;Notation of
Rhythm,&rdquo; <a href="#Par_9">Par.&nbsp;9</a>), and to refute it by showing
that there are in reality two series of accents in
each measure, at cross purposes with each other,
that, indeed, the alto, and tenor measures are an
eighth note behind the treble, though they could
not be written with separate bar-lines. This is
clear when the whole passage is seen. Observe
that the dot to the last note of a measure is
placed at the beginning of the next, to make the
overlapping clear to the eye. (Also that the
dots to the last alto and tenor quarter notes are
placed not in the space next, but in the space
next-but-one higher than the note they prolong.)
Dots are not infrequently placed thus&mdash;that
is, in or near the part of the measure with which
they synchronize&mdash;apart from any such purpose
as that just explained.</p>

<p>The dot made its first appearance in music
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_28" title="28"> </a>
about <span class="small-caps all-upper">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1300. Sometimes it had a tail

Stems.
</p>

<p><a name="Par_22">22.</a>&mdash;There is no rule as to the
length of stems, and they vary greatly.
The stems in a single group of notes are as often
as not of different lengths, according to the
position of the notes and the direction taken by
the hook. A common fault is to make them too
short, especially when the four hooks of a sixty-fourth
note have to be added. This, however,
is generally the result of a badly directed hook
(see <i>a</i>, <a href="#Fig_18">Fig.&nbsp;18</a>).</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p><a name="Par_23">23.</a>&mdash;As to the <em>direction</em> they take there is a
definite rule. In open score (when one part
only is being written on a stave), the stems of
notes <em>above</em> the middle line should be turned
<em>down</em>, the stems of those <em>below</em> the middle line
should be turned <em>up</em> (see <i>b</i>, <a href="#Fig_18">Fig.&nbsp;18</a>). The object
of this is to keep the stems within the stave and
prevent their sprawling above or below. The
ill-equipped writer betrays himself by nothing
more often than by sprawling stems.</p>

<p>The stems in a group of notes are generally
turned according to the direction of the first
note, or the majority. In a group containing a
wide skip they are often turned individually
according to the rule, involving opposite directions,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_29" title="29"> </a>
the hook being drawn between them (see
<i>c</i>, <a href="#Fig_18">Fig.&nbsp;18</a>).</p>

<p>Five exceptions are common: (1) The stem of a
grace note is almost invariably turned upwards,
though according to Dr. Hullah it should be
turned in the direction contrary to that of the
stem of the principal note, for the sake of greater
distinctness (see <i>d</i>, <a href="#Fig_18">Fig.&nbsp;18</a>). In &ldquo;copy&rdquo; for
the printer grace-notes are best written in red
ink. (2) In piano music when a single part, or
row of notes, is to be divided between the hands,
one playing one group and the other the next,
the stems of the right-hand notes are turned up,
and those of the left down (see <a href="#Fig_15">Fig.&nbsp;15</a>, latter
half of measure). (3) Similarly in some organ
music, especially that printed in Germany,
pedal notes which are to be played by the right
foot have the stems turned up, those by the left,
down. (4) In vocal music, when a subsequent
verse, though having the same notes, requires
different time-values from the first verse, or a
translation requires different time-values from
the original language, the time-values required
by one verse or language have the stems of the
notes turned up, those required by the other
down (see <i>e</i>, <a href="#Fig_18">Fig.&nbsp;18</a>, from Molique's oratorio
&ldquo;Abraham&rdquo;). (5) In music written on two
staves, when the notes of a single group skip
from one stave to the other, the hook is placed
between the staves, and the stems of the notes
on the lower stave are turned up, and of those
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_30" title="30"> </a>
on the upper stave down, irrespective of their
relation to the middle line of the stave (see <i>f</i>,
<a href="#Fig_18">Fig.&nbsp;18</a>, from the &ldquo;Moonlight&rdquo; Sonata).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 488px;">

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p><a name="Par_24">24.</a>&mdash;In short score, that is when two parts
have to be written on one stave, the stems belonging
to the upper part should be turned upwards,
and those to the lower downwards.
Only by this means can the course of the parts
be made clear to the eye. When the parts cross,
the rule must be strictly adhered to: the note
belonging to the upper <em>part</em>, not the <em>upper note</em>,
must have the upward stem. To make quite
clear which note each stem belongs to, it is well
in this case to make the notes a little less close
together than they otherwise would be (see <i>a</i>,
<a href="#Fig_19">Fig.&nbsp;19</a>, a well-known case from a chant by Sir
John Goss, where the tenor goes below the bass).
Sometimes <em>more</em> than two parts are written on
one stave; in this case the stems of two parts
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_31" title="31"> </a>
must be turned the same way, and considerable
ingenuity is required to make the course of the
parts clear. Usually the middle part varies in
the direction of its stems. Simultaneous notes
are generally written not quite in a line with
each other, to allow of separate stems: the stems
are generally rather short, so as not to run into
each other, and the hooks of simultaneous
eighths and shorter notes do not concur. Two
measures from Bach's piano fugues will illustrate
these points (<i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, <a href="#Fig_19">Fig.&nbsp;19</a>).</p>

Hooks.

<p><a name="Par_29">29.</a>&mdash;With one exception, hooks

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p><a name="Par_30">30.</a>&mdash;The exception is when longer and shorter
notes are combined in the same group. In this
case the hooks not common to the whole group
are invariably turned so as to lie <em>within</em> the
group, and, subject to this, if the group contains
more than one beat, so as to lie <em>within</em>
the beat of which they form part.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_33" title="33"> </a><a name="Par_31">31.</a>&mdash;Previous to 1660, each eighth or
shorter note had a separate hook or hooks.
But at the time of the Restoration, John Playford
substituted a connecting horizontal line
for the separate hooks of two or more eighths
belonging to the same division of the measure.
The device was copied by the Dutch, French,
and Germans. The Italians did not adopt it
till later. Thus, Marcello's Psalms, published
in Venice as late as 1724&ndash;27, have separate
hooks. (In an edition in the writer's possession,
published in 1757, <em>united</em> hooks are used, but
this is probably rather due to the <em>venue</em> than to
the later date.)</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p><a name="Par_32">32.</a>&mdash;Hooks in instrumental music must be
united in strict accordance with the laws of
rhythm (see &ldquo;Notation of Rhythm,&rdquo; pars.&nbsp;<a href="#Par_8">8</a>&ndash;13).
Thus, four eighth notes must not have the same
hook in Compound Time: they must be
grouped as three and one, or one and three, or
two and two, according to the position they
occupy in the beat they belong to. In three-four
time, six eighth notes may have one hook,
but in six-eight time they should preferably
have separate hooks of three eighth notes each.
Broadly speaking, the notes forming a single
beat of the measure should be united in one
hook, but very commonly two beats have one
hook between them, especially in four-four
time.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_34" title="34"> </a>In the case of sixteenths and shorter notes,
the outermost hook often shows the half-measure,
and the inner hook or hooks the sub-division
into beats (see <a href="#Fig_21">Fig.&nbsp;21</a>).</p>

<p><a name="Par_33">33.</a>&mdash;So closely should the hooks follow the
rhythm, that where a phrase crosses the measure
beginning at the end of one measure, and ending
at the beginning of the next, the hook
crosses the bar-line too, uniting notes in different
measures (see <i>a</i>, <a href="#Fig_22">Fig.&nbsp;22</a>). Notes may have the

or descends may either slant in the direction
taken by the notes, or may be straight (see
<i>c</i>, <a href="#Fig_22">Fig.&nbsp;22</a>). In the writer's opinion slanted
hooks are preferable as being a better guide to
the eye. In manuscript music, when hooks
have to be drawn within the stave, and not
above or below it, they should invariably be
slanted when this is possible; otherwise they
are very apt to coincide with the stave-lines,
and fail of distinctness. A common fault is in
not making them thick enough. Notes are
sometimes &ldquo;hooked&rdquo; in accordance, not with
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_35" title="35"> </a>
the rhythm, but with the hand which is to play
them (see <i>d</i>, <a href="#Fig_22">Fig.&nbsp;22</a>). This is necessitated by
the usage with regard to stems in such cases

must be the same distance from the stave,
and from each other, as the stave-lines are one

very common and very confusing. How often
a lower note looks as though above a higher one,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_36" title="36"> </a>

more importance than the appeal to the eye,

high note in <a href="#Fig_24">Fig.&nbsp;24</a> (which is several times
repeated) to have been <em>intended</em> for E, the position

But, being on the first leger-line, it <em>is</em> A, and
would be were it a yard above the stave! (The

Short Score
to Open
Score.
</p>

<p><a name="Par_47">47.</a>&mdash;Co-relatively, in transcribing
from short score to open, it will occasionally
be necessary to put accidentals
in the latter which are not in the former.
The commonest form of this is probably in
extracting a single part, soprano, alto, tenor,
or bass, from an ordinary short score hymn or
chant book, and writing it in a part-book for
the particular voice. Thus, in transcribing the
tenor of the following extract from the hymn-tune
&ldquo;Heathlands&rdquo; into a part-book, it would
be necessary to insert a natural before the A.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 288px;">

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_44" title="44"> </a><a name="Par_48">48.</a>&mdash;Far more often, however, it is necessary
to <em>omit</em> naturals used to contradict an accidental
occurring in a part which is not being copied.
Thus, in the following extract from the tune
&ldquo;Endless Alleluia,&rdquo; the natural in both the
tenor and bass would be unnecessary were these
parts written out separately from the other
parts and each other.</p>

<p>(The A sharp in the tenor of this extract suggests
C sharp so strongly apart from the rest
of the harmony, that the natural is almost a
necessity even had the previous treble C sharp
not been included. Not being required according
to rule, however, it should be enclosed in
brackets&mdash;a not infrequent, and very commendable,
device with careful writers, when an accidental
is desirable but not necessary according
to rule.)</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p><a name="Par_49">49.</a>&mdash;The stems, of course, must be turned up

below the middle line, and not as in the short

Extracting
a Single
Part.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_45" title="45"> </a><a name="Par_50">50.</a>&mdash;In copying out a single part
from a score, full or short, care must
be taken in abbreviating a number of
measures' rest. The usual way of doing this
is to write the number of measures over a single
measure, thus:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 155px;">
<a name="Fig_39"><img src="images/fig39.png" width="155" height="54" alt=""/></a>
<p class="caption">Fig.&nbsp;39.</p>
</div>

<p>But if a pause occurs in any of the other parts
of the score this will not do. The number of
bars before the pause must be counted, and the
pause&mdash;or pauses&mdash;shown in the abbreviation as
follows, assuming it to occur in the thirteenth bar:</p>

<p class="sidenote">
Accidentals.
</p>

<p><a name="Par_51">51.</a>&mdash;The necessity for inserting
accidentals in a part-copy which may
not appear in a short-score, has just been
pointed out. Yet the musical Hercules is beset
with a Charybdis as well as a Scylla. He may
be drawn into the bad and very irritating
modern habit of using accidentals which are not
really called for. Accidentals where unnecessary
are doubtless used with the object of
making assurance doubly sure. They have <em>precisely
the reverse effect</em>, besides being uncomplimentary&mdash;to
put it mildly&mdash;to the intelligence
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_46" title="46"> </a>
of the performer. Sharps, flats, and naturals
which sometimes are <em>foreign</em> to the signature,
and sometimes <em>duplicate</em> it, cause confusion
where there was previously assurance. Bad
enough at all times, they are, when one is transposing
at sight, exasperating to the last degree.</p>

<p>An accidental is operative during the bar in
which it occurs, and no further, unless it inflects
the last note of a bar, and the next bar begins
with the same note. It is so usual, however,
to contradict an accidental in the bar <em>next</em> to
that in which it occurs, that this practice may
almost be said to have become a rule, breach of
which might cause uncertainty in all but the
clearest cases. This is no justification for the
absurd practice of some writers, of contradicting
an inflection the next time the same note <em>un</em>-inflected
occurs, <em>however far off this may be</em>!</p>

<p>As a rule, a natural should only be used where
the sharp or flat to be cancelled would <em>not</em>
have to be repeated were the inflection intended
to continue.</p>

<p class="sidenote">
Legibility.
</p>

<p><a name="Par_52">52.</a>&mdash;A common cause of illegibility
in manuscript music is what may be
called a spider-like sameness in the web. Stems
and hooks&mdash;indeed sometimes stems and note-heads!&mdash;are
much of the same thickness and
blackness. Compare them in printed music,
and it will be seen that a dozen, perhaps a
score, of stems could be spun out of one hook.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_47" title="47"> </a><a name="Par_53">53.</a>&mdash;Should it be necessary to erase and rewrite
a note, the blurred effect too often resulting
may be almost entirely avoided by <em>penciling</em>
the correct note before tracing it in ink. This
produces a lead-lined groove and prevents the
ink from running.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p class="sidenote">
Facility.
</p>

<p><a name="Par_54">54.</a>&mdash;Orthography is taught by the
careful making&mdash;drawing rather than
writing&mdash;of large letters. The formation of a
more rapid and individual hand does not come
till later. So with musical phonography. The
student, at whatever cost of time and patience,
must first acquire <em>accuracy and clearness</em>. Not
till <em>these are gained</em> must he think of rapidity
and ease. Hence the consideration of facility
has been deferred to the last.</p>

<p>Facility is well worthy of consideration, especially
on the part of those who have much music
to write. A little thought will often show how
a character may be made in one stroke, which
in any other way will take two or more, and
that without any loss of clearness.</p>

<p>Thus a half note can be made in one stroke
if begun at the point where the ring joins the
stem; that is, at the <em>top</em> of the ring for upward
stems, at the <em>under part</em> for downward stems.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 120px;">
<a name="Fig_41"><img src="images/fig41.png" width="120" height="51" alt=""/></a>
<p class="caption">Fig.&nbsp;41.</p>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_48" title="48"> </a>Quarter notes may be made in one stroke if
the head be begun first when the stem is upward,
and the <em>stem</em> first when the stem is downward.</p>

<a name="Fig_42"><img src="images/fig42.png" width="101" height="46" alt=""/></a>
<p class="caption">Fig.&nbsp;42.</p>
</div>

<p>If this very simple expedient were more generally
known, the practice of writing downward
as well as upward stems at the right-hand side
of the note-head&mdash;never done in printed music&mdash;would
not be as common as it is. It should be
added that to make a quarter or half note satisfactorily
in one stroke, a pliable pen, fine, but
spreading under pressure, and rapidly recovering
itself, is necessary, otherwise the head will be
too thin or the stem too thick.</p>

<p>Eighth notes, especially those with downward
stems, are best made in two strokes. They can,
however, be made in one if begun at the <em>bottom</em>.
That is to say, those with upward stems must
be begun at the head, and those with downward
stems at the hook. This hook must be drawn
thin, if made thick the pen will scratch when
making the stem: if the head be made first the
pen ends at the wrong side for a <em>downward</em> stem.</p>

</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_49" title="49"> </a>Each shorter note requires an additional
action.</p>

<p>The G clef can be made in one stroke if
begun at the innermost part of the curl, or at
the downward extremity. The F clef requires
three strokes, owing to the dots, each of which
takes one to itself.</p>

<p>The C clef requires four movements, so does
a sharp. A flat may be made in one stroke,
but is very apt to look like a half note. A
natural requires two movements.</p>

<p>Chords may be expeditiously formed, if with
<em>downward</em> stem, by making the top note, with
stem, first, and then adding the other notes.
Chords with upward stems should be begun at
the bottom.</p>

<p>(The joinings are purposely left imperfect to
show the method. The numbers show the order
of the four actions for the four notes.)</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
